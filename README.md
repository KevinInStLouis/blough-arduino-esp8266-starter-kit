# blough-arduino-esp8266-starter-kit
A really cheap arduino starter kit using an ESP8266

## Main Parts

| Part        | Cost           | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------:| ----------------|
| __**Board**__|
| [NodeMCU ESP8266 Development Board (CP2012 version)](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/BQBAIYj)| $3.05 | This ESP8266 has everything you need to just use (once you have the software setup. There are other NodeMCU boards that are a different size that don't fit in breadboards, which would be best to avoid! |
| __**Sensors & Displays**__|
| [Soil Moisture Sensor](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/BUVbUzZ) | $0.53 | Can be used to check if a plant needs to be watered |
| [PIR Motion Sensor](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/EeiYzVb)| $0.78 | Can detect when a person is nearby |

| [LDR Module](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/nMrBiiE)| $0.37 | Can be used to detect differences in light levels |
| [Buzzer Module](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/AAq7YJQ)| $0.29 | Can be used to play different tones |
| [DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/qr3RRNf) | $0.99 | |
|[HC-SR04 Distance Sensor](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/N7MRvFa)| $0.78 |  |

## Basics Components

You will need LEDs, button and some other parts to connect the sensors and the board together. I'll provide two options:

- **Option 1:** Is the cheapest kit I could find but it won't cover doing much other projects outside the ones listed here. I've found the breadboards that come with this kit to be pretty poor, but have been usable (just very stiff)
- **Option 2:** Is a more complete kit for someone looking to get started with Arduino. It should cover a lot of the basic components that are required for most Arduino projects. It might even be worth picking up this list of stuff after option 1 if you think you'll continue on with Arduino

| Part        | Cost           | Description  |
| ------------- | -------------:| ----------------|
| **Option 1: Cheap and cheerful**|
| [Basic starter kit](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/RFU3Z33) | $2.42 | Contains a breadboard, LEDs, buttons, jumper wires and resistors.|
| [100PCs 2N2222 Transistors](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/YfQNfmy)| $0.99 | We actually only need one, but I didn't see any smaller packs!|
| **Option 2: Complete Kit**|
| [Good Solderless Breadboard](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/fufyjMv)| $1.78 | This is pretty close in price to the basic starter kit which includes a breadboard, but I have found these to be very good quality. You can buy cheaper ones (around a $1 each) but do yourself a favour and spend the extra few cent!|
|  [300PCs Resistor Set](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/qNBaAE6)| $1.57      | A huge range of resistors that should do you a long, long time |
| [100PCs LED Kit](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/eyRRBA2) | $0.90 | 20 each of Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and White Leds |
| [10PCs Tactile button kit](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/6uv7QNj) | $0.40 | Comes with plastic caps as well |
| [200PCs Transistor Assortment Kit](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/3fuZFQ3) | $2.56 | 20PCs of 10 different transistors in a plastic box |
| [40Pcs M-M Jumper Wires](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/BiujMFu)| $0.65 | Will be used to connect things together on the breadboard.|
| [40Pcs M-F Jumper Wires](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/N7AQ7YN)| $0.65 | Can be used to connect displays and modules to the breadboard.|
